# Wrangling-WeRateDogs
Udacity Data Wrangling final project using WeRateDogs Twitter account

Coding was done in a Jupyter notebook using Python. The goal of the project was to show proficiency with gathering data from multiple sources, wrangling it, and then extracting useful insights from the cleaned data.

Data Files:
twitter-archive-enhanced.csv - this was a file on-hand, and was uploaded directly
image-predictions.tsv - this file was hosted on Udacity's site, and was downloaded programmatically
tweet_json.txt - this file was created using data pulled with the Twitter API
twitter_archive_master.csv - this is a combination of the other three files, after wrangling

Code Files:
wrangle_act.ipynb - main code file
wrangle_report.pdf - summary of wrangling efforts
act_report.pdf - summary of method and findings
